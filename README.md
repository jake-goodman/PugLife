# PugLife

## Notes


### Cocoapods
This project is using Cocoapods for dependency management. I have included the Pods directory and .xcworkspace file so no additional steps should be necessary to run the project, but if issues arise:
1. Make sure you are using Puglife.xcworkspace instead of Puglife.xcodeproj
2. Run `pod install` from the project directory
